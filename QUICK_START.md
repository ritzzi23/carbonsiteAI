- **Modern UI**: Built with Streamlit and custom CSS
- **Intelligent Scoring**: 5-factor weighted algorithm
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant results based on preferences
- **Interactive Maps**: Geographic visualization
- **Export Features**: Professional reports for stakeholders

### **Business Value**
- **Faster Decisions**: Site selection in hours, not months
- **Risk Reduction**: Data-driven analysis
- **Stakeholder Confidence**: Professional reports and visualizations
- **Scalability**: Ready for production deployment

## üîß **If Something Goes Wrong**

### **Streamlit Won't Start**
```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :8501

# Kill process if needed
kill -9 <PID>

# Try different port
streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502
```

### **Import Errors**
```bash
# Install missing packages
pip install streamlit-folium plotly folium

# Check Python version (needs 3.8+)
python --version
```

### **Demo Data Issues**
```bash
# Test the data module
python utils/site_data.py

# Run the demo script
python demo.py
```

## üì± **Demo Tips**

### **Before the Presentation**
1. **Test everything** - make sure the app works
2. **Prepare your pitch** - practice the flow
3. **Have backup plans** - know what to do if something breaks
4. **Time your demo** - aim for 3-5 minutes

### **During the Presentation**
1. **Start with the problem** - Turnover Labs' requirements
2. **Show the solution** - CarbonSiteAI interface
3. **Run the analysis** - demonstrate the workflow
4. **Highlight results** - show the top sites
5. **End with value** - business impact and next steps

### **Q&A Preparation**
- **How does the scoring work?** - 5 weighted factors
- **What data sources?** - EPA, Census, industrial databases
- **How accurate is it?** - Based on real industrial data
- **Can it scale?** - Ready for production deployment
