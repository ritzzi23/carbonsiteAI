# üèÜ CarbonSiteAI - Hackathon Project Summary

## üéØ **Project Overview**

**CarbonSiteAI** is an intelligent site selection system designed specifically for **Turnover Labs** to identify optimal locations for their first-of-a-kind (FOAK) carbon conversion facilities. This project directly addresses the challenge from **Track 2: Turnover Labs - Facility Site Selection**.

## üè≠ **What Turnover Labs Wants (From Their Slide)**

Our solution directly addresses all 5 key requirements:

1. ‚úÖ **FOAK pilot site (50-100 tons/year) expandable to 1-5k tons**
   - Our system evaluates scalability potential and land availability
   - Identifies sites with room for expansion

2. ‚úÖ **Nearby off-taker of products**
   - Analyzes proximity to chemical manufacturers, refineries, fuel blenders
   - Maps potential buyers within 50-mile radius

3. ‚úÖ **Financial returns with minimal incentive support**
   - Calculates ROI based on energy costs, land availability, infrastructure
   - Focuses on long-term viability without heavy subsidies

4. ‚úÖ **Project that works in today's policy climate**
   - Evaluates current regulatory environment
   - No dependency on future policy changes

5. ‚úÖ **Verifiable emissions avoidance or reduction**
   - Proximity to point-source CO‚ÇÇ emitters
   - Calculates projected emissions reduction

## üìä **Scoring Methodology**

Our AI system uses a weighted scoring approach based on Turnover Labs' priorities:

| Criterion | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **CO‚ÇÇ Availability** | 25% | Proximity to industrial CO‚ÇÇ sources |
| **Off-taker Proximity** | 30% | Nearby buyers for carbon-neutral products |
| **Financial Viability** | 20% | ROI without heavy subsidies |
| **Scalability** | 15% | Expansion potential from pilot to commercial |
| **Policy Ready** | 10% | Current regulatory climate compatibility |

## üéÆ **How to Use**

### **1. Start the Application**
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 8501
```

### **2. Configure Your Project**
- Select project type (CO‚ÇÇ to Methanol, Ethanol, etc.)
- Set capacity requirements (initial and target)
- Choose target regions (TX, LA, CA, OH, PA, etc.)
- Adjust priority weights for different criteria

### **3. Analyze Sites**
- Click "Analyze Sites" to run the analysis
- Review top site recommendations with scores
- Explore detailed breakdowns for each location
- View geographic overview on interactive maps

### **4. Generate Reports**
- Compare sites using radar charts
- Download detailed analysis reports
- Export site data for further analysis

## üèÜ **Demo Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: CO‚ÇÇ to Methanol Plant**
- **Location**: Texas/Louisiana region
- **Capacity**: 100 tons/year ‚Üí 5,000 tons/year
- **Result**: Baton Rouge, LA (Score: 94/100)

### **Scenario 2: CO‚ÇÇ to Synthetic Fuels**
- **Location**: California
- **Capacity**: 150 tons/year ‚Üí 3,000 tons/year
- **Focus**: Low-carbon fuel standards compliance

### **Scenario 3: CO‚ÇÇ to Chemicals**
